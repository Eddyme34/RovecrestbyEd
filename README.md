# University Rover Challenge - Backend & Frontend

## Camera Test
1. Spin up server by running `python3 server_rover.py` (for Electron client, use `server_rover_without_video_py.py`).
2. Connect to server with client in a different terminal:
    * Python client: `python3 client_rover.py`
    * Electron client: In UI directory run: `npm start`
      Still in development. Currently it is __very__ laggy.
